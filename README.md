# UsefulSkips
This is a very simple mod that is partly inspired by the now-defunct QuickStart.

You can start a new campaign straight from the main menu in one click.

Unlike other similar mods that skip the splash screen and campaign intro by replacing the video files with blank ones, this mod skips them entirely with code.

It is safe to install and uninstall on an existing save.
